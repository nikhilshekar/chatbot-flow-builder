## Features

1. **Text Node**:

   - Our flow builder currently supports only one type of message (i.e Text Message).
   - There can be multiple Text Nodes in one flow.
   - Nodes are added to the flow by dragging and dropping a Node from the Nodes Panel.

2. **Nodes Panel**:

   - This panel houses all kind of Nodes that our Flow Builder supports.
   - Right now there is only Message Node, but we ºd be adding more types of Nodes in the future so make this section extensible 

3. **Edges**:

   - Connects two Nodes together.

4. **Source Handle**:

   - Source of a connecting edge 
   - Can only have one edge originating from a source handle

5. **Target Handle**:

   - Target of a connecting edge
   - Can have more than one edge connecting to a target handle 

6. **Settings Panel**:

   - Settings Panel will replace the Nodes Panel when a Node is selected
   - It has a text field to edit text of the selected Text Node

7. **Save Button**:

   - Button to save the flow 
   - Save button press will show an error if there are more than one Nodes and more than one Node has empty target handles
